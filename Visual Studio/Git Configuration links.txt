Git Configuration

I had this too and couldn't find anywhere on StackOverflow with the following useful nugget clearly stated: Git won't let you push to a different branch if your working branch has diverged from it. There's an easy fix - just switch to the branch you want to push to and merge your working branch into it. So instead of trying this:

git push origin master   <========== On "mybranch"
Do this:

git checkout master      <========== Switch to the branch you want to push to
git pull origin master   <========== Get latest from remote repository
git pull origin mybranch <========== Merge in changes from "mybranch"
======== Resolve any issues ========
git push origin master   <========== Push the merged changes
